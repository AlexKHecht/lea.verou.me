  				<h2>Lea Verou</h2>
  				<p>Lea is a front-end engineer currently living in Greece. She discovered programming at the young age of 12 (web development a few years after) and it was love at first …line. In 2008, she co-founded Fresset Ltd, whose websites have attracted a large audience in the Greek internet scene and is currently working frantically on their first international project. Fed up with the lack of proper web development education, she co-organized a course at AUEB, which teaches  all aspects of modern, standards-based Web development, including CSS3, HTML5 and ES5 as regular parts of its content. During her spare time, she blogs about her thoughts &amp; findings on CSS, JavaScript and web usability at leaverou.me.</p>

Hi, Iâ€™m Lea and I wear many hats.
I design and build [tools](/projects/) that help people create on the Web.
I [design](/publications/#specifications) and [review](/blog/2022/11/tag-2/) technologies implemented in every browser.
I do [scientific research](/publications/#research) at [MIT](https://haystack.csail.mit.edu) on democratizing web development.
I [speak](/speaking/), [teach](https://designftw.mit.edu), and [write](/publications/) about things I learn and discover.
Sometimes I [blog](/blog/) about all this (and more!).

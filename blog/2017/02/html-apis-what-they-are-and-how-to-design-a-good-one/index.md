I wrote [an article over at Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/designing-html-apis/) aimed at JavaScript library developers that want their libraries to be usable via HTML (i.e. without writing any JavaScript). Sounds interesting? [Read it here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/designing-html-apis/).

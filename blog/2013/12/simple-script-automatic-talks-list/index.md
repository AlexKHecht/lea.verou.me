I guess this will not be useful to many, but thought I'd open source it anyway, in case someone else finds it useful. I mostly wrote it because after 50+ conferences, I got seriously fed up updating [the list](http://lea.verou.me/speaking) by editing the HTML manually. Now I will only have to edit [a JSON file](http://leaverou.github.io/talks/talks.json) manually! :P

Admittedly, it’s not my best code (more like a quick hack), but it should be pretty easy to adapt to your needs, even to adapt it to lists of different things instead of talks. Using it for talks is very straight forward: Include the CSS and JS, add a list with a class of "talks" where you want it, done.

Hope you enjoy it :)

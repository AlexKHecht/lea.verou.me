You might have heard about [W3Conf](http://w3.org/conf), [W3C](http://w3.org)’s conference for web designers and developers. This year, I have the pleasure of not only speaking there but also organizing it, along with [Doug Schepers](http://twitter.com/shepazu) and designing the [website](http://w3.org/conf) for it.

Alongside with yours truly, it features an excellent lineup of amazing speakers like [Eric Meyer](http://twitter.com/meyerweb), [Alexis Deveria](https://twitter.com/Fyrd) of [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/) fame, [Nicolas Gallagher](https://twitter.com/necolas) and many others. You can use coupon code **VEROU** to get **$100 off** the already affordable Early Bird price of **$300**. But hurry up, cause Early Bird prices are only valid **until January 31st**!

Hope to see you there!

[![](images/spk_verou.png "Illustration of me!")](images/spk_verou.png)I don’t usually like to advertise my talks or workshops through blog posts, and even though I've given a lot, I've only posted about less a handful. However, this one is special: **It might be my last**. Don’t get me wrong: I LOVE giving workshops, teaching people new things and seeing them put them in use right away is fantastic. However, I also find them incredibly exhausting. Speaking for an entire day (or sometimes two!) is pretty much the most tiring thing I've done. So, given [my new job at W3C](http://lea.verou.me/2012/08/lea-at-w3-org/), I'm not sure if I will do one again. Of course, it goes without saying that I will still do plenty of talks! :)

The last workshop on my schedule is in [FromTheFront conference in Bologna, Italy](http://2012.fromthefront.it/) on **September 20th** (in 7 days!). There are still some spots available, so [grab yours while you still can](http://2012.fromthefront.it/index.html#cart)! It only costs **€329.00**. It will be very hands-on, with interactive exercises that help you gain first-hand experience with small but advanced use cases. It will not be your usual CSS3-overview kind of workshop. Instead, we will dive really deep into a handful of CSS3 aspects that I think are most useful for your everyday work.

While you’re at it, I’d also recommend getting a conference ticket as well. The [line-up](http://2012.fromthefront.it/speakers.html) has some excellent speakers and it’s only €110 more, so totally worth it!

Apologies that my last two blog posts were personal, the next one will be more technical: I have a very useful tool in the pipeline that I’m gonna release soon ;)

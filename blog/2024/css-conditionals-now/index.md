<div class=nutshell>

The CSS WG [resolved](../css-conditionals/) to add `if()` to CSS, but that won‚Äôt be in browsers for a while.
What are our options in the meantime?
</div>

A couple days ago, I posted about the recent [CSS WG resolution to add an `if()` function to CSS](../css-conditionals/).
Great as it may be, this is still a long way off, two years if everything goes super smoothly, more if not.
So what can you do when you need conditionals *right now*?

You may be pleased to find that you‚Äôre not _completely_ out of luck.
There is a series of brilliant, horrible hacks that enable you to expose the kinds of higher level custom properties that conditionals typically enable.

## Using hacks in production?! { #hacks-in-production }

The instinctive reaction many developers have when seeing hacks like these is ‚ÄúNice hack, but can‚Äôt _possibly_ ever use this in production‚Äù.
This sounds reasonable on the surface (keeping the codebase maintainable is a worthy goal!) but
when examined deeply, it reflects the wrong order of priorities,
prioritizing developer convenience over user convenience.

The [TAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Architecture_Group) maintains a [Web Platform Design Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/) document [^1]
that everyone designing APIs for the web platform is supposed to read and follow.
I‚Äôm a strong believer in having published Design Principles, for any product[^product].
They help stay on track, and remember what the big picture vision is, which is otherwise easy to lose sight of in the day to day minutiae.
One of the core principles in the document is the [Priority of Constituencies](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies).
The core of it is:

[^product]: I‚Äôm using _product_ here in the general sense, of any software product, technology, or API, not just for-profit or commercial ones.

> User needs come before the needs of web page authors, which come before the needs of user agent implementors, which come before the needs of specification writers, which come before theoretical purity.

Obviously in most projects there are far fewer stakeholders than for the whole web platform,
but the spirit of the principle still applies:
**the higher the abstraction, the higher priority the user needs**.

For a more relatable example, in a web app using a framework like e.g. Vue and several Vue components,
the user needs of website users come before the needs of the web app developers,
which come before the needs of the developers of its Vue components,
which come before the needs of the Vue framework developers (sorry Evan :).

Like all principles, this isn‚Äôt absolute.
A small gain in user convenience is not a good tradeoff when it requires tremendous implementation complexity.
But as a rule of thumb it‚Äôs a good north star to follow.

The TAG did not invent this principle; it is well known in UX and Product circles with a number of different wordings:
- ‚ÄúPut the pain on those who can bear it‚Äù
- Prefer internal complexity over external complexity

Why is that? Several reasons:
- It is _far_ easier to change the implementation than to change the user-facing API, so it‚Äôs worth making sacrifices to keep it clean from the get go.
- Most products have way more users than developers, so this minimizes collective pain.
- Internal complexity can be managed far more easily, with tooling or even good comments.
- Managing complexity internally localizes it and contains it better.
- Once the underlying platform improves, only one codebase needs to be changed to reap the benefits.

[^1]: I‚Äôve always thought this was our most important deliverable, and pushed for prioritizing it. Recently, I even became editor of it. üôÉ

The corollary is that if hacks allow you to expose a nicer API to component users, it may be worth the increase in internal complexity (to a degree).
Just make sure that part of the code is well commented, and keep track of it so you can return to it once the platform has evolved to not require a hack anymore.

As to whether custom properties are a better option to control styling than e.g. attributes, I listed several arguments for that in my [previous article](../css-conditionals/#why).

### When is it not a good idea to use do this?

In a nutshell, when the abstraction is likely to leak.
**Ugliness is only acceptable if it‚Äôs encapsulated and not exposed to component users.**
If there is a high chance they may come into contact with it, it might be a better idea to simply use attributes and call it a day.

<figure>

![A series of callouts with --variant declarations next to them](images/callouts.png)
<figcaption>Example callouts with three variants.</figcaption>
</figure>

In many of the examples below, I use variants as the canonical example of a custom property that a component may want to expose.
However, if component consumers may need to customize each variant, it may be better to use attributes so they can just use e.g. `[variant="success"]` instead of having to understand whatever crazy hack was used to expose a `--variant` custom property.
And even from a philosophical purity perspective, variants are on the brink of presentational vs semantic anyway.

## The current state of the art

There is a host of hacks and workarounds that people have come up with to make up for the lack of inline conditionals in CSS,
with the first ones dating back to as early as 2015.

### 1. Binary Linear Interpolation { #binary-linear-interpolation }

This was [first documented by Roma Komarov in 2016](https://kizu.dev/conditions-for-css-variables/), and has since been used in a number of creative ways.
The gist of this method is to use essentially the [linear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation) formula for mapping $[0, 1]$ to $[a, b]$:

$$p \times a + (1 - p) \times b$$

However, instead of using this to map a range to another range,
we use it to map two points to two other points,
basically the two extremes of both ranges: $p=0$ and $p=1$ to select $a$ and $b$ respectively.

This was Roma‚Äôs original example:

```css
:root {
		--is-big: 0;
}

.is-big {
		--is-big: 1;
}

.block {
		padding: calc(
				25px * var(--is-big) +
				10px * (1 - var(--is-big))
		);
		border-width: calc(
				3px * var(--is-big) +
				1px * (1 - var(--is-big))
		);
}
```

He even expands it to multiple conditions by multiplying the interpolation factors.
E.g. this code snippet to map `0` to `100px`, `1` to `20px`, and `2` to `3px`:

```css
.block {
		padding: calc(
				100px * (1 - var(--foo)) * (2 - var(--foo)) * 0.5 +
				20px  * var(--foo) * (2 - var(--foo)) +
				3px   * var(--foo) * (1 - var(--foo)) * -0.5
		);
}
```

Which these days could be rewritten as this, which also makes the boolean logic at play clearer:

```css
.block {
		--if-not-0: min(max(0 - var(--foo), var(--foo) - 0), 1);
		--if-not-1: min(max(1 - var(--foo), var(--foo) - 1), 1);
		--if-not-2: min(max(2 - var(--foo), var(--foo) - 2), 1);

		--if-0: var(--if-not-1) * var(--if-not-2);
		--if-1: var(--if-not-0) * var(--if-not-2);
		--if-2: var(--if-not-0) * var(--if-not-1);

		padding: calc(
				100px * var(--if-0) +
				20px  * var(--if-1) +
				3px   * var(--if-2)
		);
}
```

Back then, `min()` and `max()` were not available, so he had to divide each factor by an obscure constant to make it equal to 1 when it was not `0`.
Once `abs()` ships this will be even simpler (the inner `max()` is basically getting the absolute value of `N - var(--foo)`)

Ana Tudor also wrote about this in 2018, in this very visual article: [DRY Switching with CSS Variables](https://css-tricks.com/dry-switching-with-css-variables-the-difference-of-one-declaration/).
Pretty sure she was also using boolean algebra on these too (multiplication = AND, addition = OR), but I couldn‚Äôt find the exact post.

### 2. Toggles (Space Toggle, Cyclic Toggles) { #toggles }

This was independently discovered by Ana Tudor ([c. 2017](https://twitter.com/anatudor/status/1284160219963170816)),
Jane Ori [in April 2020](https://twitter.com/Jane0ri/status/1282303255826046977) (who gave it the name ‚ÄúSpace Toggle‚Äù),
David Khoursid (aka David K Piano) in [June 2020](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1284163706016927746) (he [called it](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1284155737720205313) prop-and-lock),
and yours truly in [Oct 2020](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2020/10/the-var-space-hack-to-toggle-multiple-values-with-one-custom-property/) (I called it the --var: ; hack, arguably the worst name of the three üòÖ).

The core idea is that `var(--foo, fallback)` is actually a very limited form of conditional: if `--foo` is `initial` (or IACVT), it falls back to `fallback`, otherwise it‚Äôs `var(--foo)`.
Furthermore, we can set custom properties (or their fallbacks) to empty values to get them to be ignored when used as part of a property value.
It looks like this:

```css
:root {
	--if-success: ;
	--if-warning: ;
}
.success {
	--if-success: initial;
}

.warning {
	--if-warning: initial;
}

.callout {
	background:
		var(--if-success, var(--color-success-90))
		var(--if-warning, var(--color-warning-90));
}
```

One of the downsides of this version is that it only supports two states per variable.
Note how we needed two variables for the two states.
Another downside is that there is no way to specify a fallback if none of the relevant variables are set.
In the example above, if neither `--if-success` nor `--if-warning` are set, the `background` declaration will be empty, and thus become IACVT which will make it `transparent`.

#### Cyclic Toggles

In 2023, Roma Komarov expanded the technique into what he called [‚ÄúCyclic Dependency Space Toggles‚Äù](https://kizu.dev/cyclic-toggles/) which
addresses both limitations:
it supports any number of states,
and allows for a default value.
The core idea is that variables do not only become `initial` when they are not set, or are explicitly set to `initial`,
but also when cycles are encountered.

<aside class=info>
What is a cycle? A cycle is when a variable references itself, either directly or indirectly.
The most trivial cycle is `--foo: var(--foo);`, but they can have any number of steps, e.g.:

```css
--foo: var(--bar);
--bar: var(--baz);
--baz: var(--foo);
```
</aside>

Roma‚Äôs technique depends on this behavior by producing cycles on all but one of the variables used for the values.
It looks like this:

```css
.info {
	--variant: var(--variant-default);

	--variant-default: var(--variant,);
	--variant-success: var(--variant,);
	--variant-warning: var(--variant,);
	--variant-error:	 var(--variant,);

	background:
		var(--variant-default, lavender)
		var(--variant-success, palegreen)
		var(--variant-warning, khaki)
		var(--variant-error,   lightpink);
}
```

And is used like this:

```css
.my-warning {
	--variant: var(--variant-warning);
}
```

#### Layered Toggles

A big downside of most of these methods (except for the animation-based ones) is that you need to specify all values of the property in one place,
and the declaration gets applied whether your custom property has a value or not,
which makes it difficult to layer composable styles leading to some undesirable couplings.

Roma Komarov‚Äôs [‚ÄúLayered Toggles‚Äù](https://kizu.dev/layered-toggles/) method addresses this for some cases
by allowing us to decouple the different values by taking advantage of Cascade Layers.
The core idea is that Cascade Layers include a `revert-layer` keyword that will cause the current layer to be ignored wrt the declaration it‚Äôs used on.
Given that we can use unnamed layers, we can simply user a `@layer {}` rule for every block of properties we want to apply conditionally.

This approach does have some severe limitations which made it rather unpractical for my use cases.
The biggest one is that anything in a layer has lower priority than any unlayered styles,
which makes it prohibitive for many use cases.
Also, this doesn‚Äôt really simplify cyclic toggles, you still need to set all values in one place.
Still, worth a look as there are some use cases it can be helpful for.

### 3. Paused animations { #paused-animations }

The core idea behind this method is that paused animations (`animation-play-state: paused`) can still be advanced by setting `animation-delay` to a negative value.
For example in an animation like `animation: 100s foo`, you can access the 50% mark by setting `animation-delay: -50s`.
It‚Äôs trivial to transform raw numbers to `<time>` values, so this can be abstracted to plain numbers for the user-facing API.

Here is a simple example to illustrate how this works:

```css
@keyframes color-mixin {
	0% { background: var(--color-neutral-90); border-color: var(--color-neutral-80); }
	25% { background: var(--color-success-90); border-color: var(--color-success-80); }
	50% { background: var(--color-warning-90); border-color: var(--color-warning-80); }
	75% { background: var(--color-danger-90); border-color: var(--color-danger-80); }
}

button {
	animation: foo 100s calc(var(--variant) * -100s / 4 ) infinite paused;
}
```

Used like:
```css
.error button {
	--variant: 2;
}
```

This is merely to illustrate the core idea, having a `--variant` property that takes numbers is not a good API!
Though the numbers could be aliased to variables, so that users would set `--variant: var(--success)`.

This technique seems to have been [first documented by me in 2015](https://youtu.be/eVnUDTtOLE0?t=1167), during a talk about ‚Ä¶pie charts
(I would swear I showed it in an earlier talk but I cannot find it).
I never bothered writing about it, but [someone else did](https://au.si/css-conditions-today), 4 years later.

To ensure you don‚Äôt get slightly interpolated values due to precision issues, you could also slap a `steps()` in there:

```css
button {
	animation: foo 100s calc(var(--variant) * -100s / 4 ) infinite paused steps(4);
}
```

This is especially useful when 100 divided by your number of values produces repeating decimals,
e.g. 3 steps means your keyframes are at increments of `33.33333%`.

A benefit of this method is that defining each state is done with regular declarations, not involving any weirdness,
and that .

It does also have some obvious downsides:
- Values restricted to numbers
- Takes over the `animation` property, so you can‚Äôt use it for actual animations.

### 4. Type Grinding { #type-grinding }

So far all of these methods impose constraints on the API exposed by these custom properties:
numbers by the linear interpolation method and weird values that have to be hidden behind variables
for the space toggle and cyclic toggle methods.

In October 2022, Jane Ori was the first one to discover a method that actually allows us to support plain keywords,
which is what the majority of these use cases needs.
She called it [‚ÄúCSS-Only Type Grinding‚Äù](https://www.bitovi.com/blog/css-only-type-grinding-casting-tokens-into-useful-values).

Its core idea is if a custom property is registered (via either `@property` or `CSS.registerProperty()`),
assigning values to it that are not valid for its syntax makes it IACVT (Invalid at computed value time) and it falls back to its initial (or inherited) value.

She takes advantage of that to progressively transform keywords to other keywords or numbers through a series of intermediate registered custom properties,
each substituting one more value for another.

I was recently independently experimenting with a similar idea.
It started from a use case of one of my components where I wanted to implement a `--size` property with two values: `normal` and `large`.
Style queries could *almost* get me there, but I also needed to set `flex-flow: column` on the element itself when `--size` was `large`.

The end result takes N + 1 `@property` rules, where N is the number of distinct values you need to support.
The first one is the rule defining the syntax of your _actual_ property:

```css
@property --size {
	syntax: "normal | large",
	initial-value: normal;
	inherits: true;
}
```

Then, you define N more rules, each progressively substituting one value for another:

```css
@property --size-step-1 {
	syntax: "row | large";
	initial-value: row;
	inherits: false;
}

@property --size-step-end {
	syntax: "row | column";
	initial-value: column;
	inherits: false;
}
```

And at the component host you daisy chain them like this:

```css
:host {
	--size-step-1: var(--size);
	--size-step-end: var(--size-step-1);
	flex-flow: var(--size-step-end);
}
```

And component consumers get a really nice API:

```css
.my-component {
	--size: large;
}
```

You can [see it in action in this codepen](https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/OJYzQjN/c8ec7595b68381e99d38441487db546f):

	on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

You can use the same general idea to [transform more keywords](https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/rNgpRMR/d5b5cb91be7a39d9a9974e3e0239e7dd)
or to [transform keywords into different sets of keywords for use in different properties](https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/pompYrQ/75b6c0dcdfd367410011bab93fbab251).

We can also transform keywords to numbers, by replacing successive keywords with `<integer>` in the syntax, one at a time, with different initial values each time.
Here is the `--variant` example using this method:

```css
@property --variant {
	syntax: "none | success | warning | danger";
	initial-value: none;
	inherits: true;
}


@property --variant-step-1 {
	syntax: "none | <integer> | warning | danger";
	initial-value: 1;
	inherits: false;
}

@property --variant-step-2 {
	syntax: "none | <integer> | danger";
	initial-value: 2;
	inherits: false;
}

@property --variant-step-3 {
	syntax: "none | <integer>";
	initial-value: 3;
	inherits: false;
}

@property --variant-index {
	syntax: "<integer>";
	initial-value: 0;
	inherits: false;
}

.callout {
	--variant-step-1: var(--variant);
	--variant-step-2: var(--variant-step-1);
	--variant-step-3: var(--variant-step-2);
	--variant-index: var(--variant-step-3);

	/* Now use --variant-index to set other values */
}
```

Then, we can use techniques like [linear range mapping](https://forsethingvild.medium.com/lea-verous-dynamic-css-secrets-takeaways-d281218de60a#6ca0) to transform it to a length or a percentage ([generator](https://css.land/ranges/))
or [recursive `color-mix()`](https://noahliebman.net/2024/04/recursion-in-the-stylesheet/) to use that number to select an appropriate color.

### 5. Variable animation name { #variable-animation-name }

In 2018, Roma Komarov [discovered](https://codepen.io/kizu/details/vVNpXj) another method that allows plain keywords to be used as the custom property API,
forgot about it, then [rediscovered](https://codepen.io/kizu/pen/YzRXXXL) it in June 2023 üòÖ.
He still never wrote about it, so these codepens are the only documentation we have.
It‚Äôs a variation of the previous method: instead of using a single `@keyframes` rule and switching between them via `animation-delay`,
define several separate `@keyframes` rules, each named after the keyword we want to use:

```css
@keyframes success {
	from, to {
		background-color: var(--color-success-90);
		border-color: var(--color-success-80);
	}
}
@keyframes warning {
	from, to {
		background-color: var(--color-warning-90);
		border-color: var(--color-warning-80);
	}
}
@keyframes danger {
	from, to {
		background-color: var(--color-danger-90);
		border-color: var(--color-danger-80);
	}
}

.callout {
	padding: 1em;
	margin: 1rem;
	border: 3px solid var(--color-neutral-80);
	background: var(--color-neutral-90);

	animation: var(--variant) 0s paused both;
}
```

Used like:

```css
.warning {
	--variant: warning;
}
```

The obvious downsides of this method are:
- Impractical to use outside of Shadow DOM due to the potential for name clashes.
- Takes over the `animation` property, so you can‚Äôt use it for actual animations.

## Improvements

Every one of these methods has limitations, some of which are inerent in its nature, but others can be improved upon.
In this section I will discuss some improvements that me or others have thought of.
I decided to include these in a separate section, since they affect more than one method.

### Making animation-based approaches cascade better

A big downside with the animation-based approaches (3 and 5) is the place of animations in the cascade:
properties applied via animation keyframes can only be overridden via other animations or `!important`.

One way to deal with that is to set custom properties in the animation keyframes, that you apply in regular rules.
To use the example from [Variable animation name](#variable-animation-name):

```css
@keyframes success {
	from, to {
		--background-color: var(--color-success-90);
		--border-color: var(--color-success-80);
	}
}
@keyframes warning {
	from, to {
		--background-color: var(--color-warning-90);
		--border-color: var(--color-warning-80);
	}
}
@keyframes danger {
	from, to {
		--background-color: var(--color-danger-90);
		--border-color: var(--color-danger-80);
	}
}

.callout {
	padding: 1em;
	margin: 1rem;
	border: 3px solid var(--border-color, var(--color-neutral-80));
	background-color: var(--background-color, var(--color-neutral-90));

	animation: var(--variant) 0s paused both;
}
```

Note that you can combine the two approaches (variable animation-name and [paused animations](#paused-animations))
when you have two custom properties where each state of the first corresponds to N distinct states of the latter.
For example, a `--variant` that sets colors, and a light/dark mode within each variant that sets different colors.

### Making animation-based approaches compose better with author code

Another downside of the animation-based approaches is that they take over the `animation` property.
If authors want to apply an animation to your component, suddenly a bunch of unrelated things stop working, which is not great user experience.

There isn‚Äôt that much to do here to prevent this experience, but you can at least offer a way out:
instead of defining your animations directly on `animation`, define them on a custom property, e.g. `--core-animations`.
Then, if authors want to apply their own animations, they just make sure to also include `var(--core-animations)` before or after.

### Discrete color scales

Many of the approaches above are based on numerical values, which are then mapped to the value we actually want.
For numbers or [dimensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#dimensions), this is easy.
But what about colors?

I linked to Noah Liebman‚Äôs post above on [recursive `color-mix()`](https://noahliebman.net/2024/04/recursion-in-the-stylesheet/),
where he presents a rather complex method to select among a continuous color scale based on a 0-1 number.

However, if you don‚Äôt care about any intermediate colors and just want to select among a few discrete colors, the method can be a lot simpler.
Simple enough to be specified inline.

Let me explain: Since `color-mix()` only takes two colors, we need to nest them to select among more than 2, no way around that.
However, the percentages we calculate can be very simple: `100%` when we want to select the first color and `0%` otherwise.
I plugged these numbers into my [CSS range mapping tool](https://css.land/ranges/)
([example](https://css.land/ranges/?min_x=2&min_y=100%&max_x=3&max_y=0%&variableName=variant-index)) and noticed a pattern:
If we want to output `100%` when our variable (e.g. `--variant-index`) is N-1 and `0%` when it‚Äôs N, we can use `100% * (N - var(--variant-index))`.

We can use this on every step of the mixing:

```css
background: color-mix(in oklab,
	var(--stone-2) calc(100% * (1 - var(--color-index, 0))), /* default color */
	color-mix(in oklab,
		var(--green-2) calc(100% * (2 - var(--color-index))),
		color-mix(in oklab,
			var(--yellow-2) calc(100% * (3 - var(--color-index))),
			var(--red-2)
		)
	)
);
```

But what happens when the resulting percentage is < 0% or > 100%?
Generally, [percentages outside [0%, 100%] make `color-mix()` invalid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-5/#color-mix-percent-norm),
which would indicate that we need to take care to keep our percentages within that range (via `clamp()` or `max()`).
However, [within math functions there is no parse-time range-checking](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#calc-range),
so values are simply clamped to the allowed range.

Here is a simple example that you can play with ([codepen](https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/ZENxGjX?editors=0100)):

And here is a more realistic one, using the [Type Grinding](#type-grinding) method to transform keywords to numbers, and then using the above technique to select among 4 colors for backgrounds and borders ([codepen](https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/rNgJoJe)).

## Combining approaches

There are two components to each method: the input values it supports, i.e. your custom property API that you will expose, e.g. numbers, keywords, etc.,
and the output values it supports (`<dimension>`, keywords, etc.).

Even without doing anything, we can combine methods that support the same type of input values,
e.g. [Binary Linear Interpolation](#binary-linear-interpolation) and [Paused animations](#paused-animations)
or [Type Grinding](#type-grinding) and [Variable animation names](#named-paused-animations).

If we can transform the input values of one method to the input values of another, we can mix and match approaches to maximize flexibility.
For example, we can use [type grinding](#type-grinding) to transform keywords to numbers, and then use [paused animations](#paused-animations) or [binary linear interpolation](#binary-linear-interpolation) to select among a number of quantitative values based on that number.

Keywords ‚Üí Numbers
: Type grinding

Numbers ‚Üí Keywords
: We can use [paused animations](#paused-animations) to select among a number of keywords based on a number (which we transform to a negative `animation-delay`).

Space toggles ‚Üí Numbers
: Easy: `--number: calc(0 var(--toggle, + 1))`

Numbers ‚Üí Space toggles
: Once again, [Roma Komarov has come up with a very cool trick](https://codepen.io/kizu/pen/zYQdamG): he conditionally applies an animation which interpolates two custom properties from `initial` to the empty value and vice versa ‚Äî basically [variable animation names](#named-paused-animations) but used on an internal value.
Unfortunately [a Firefox bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1763376) prevents it from working interoperably.
He also tried [a variant for space toggles](https://codepen.io/kizu/pen/BaedVMP) but that has even worse compatibility, limited to Chrome only.
I [modified his idea a bit](https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/eYaMdMN?editors=1100) to use [paused animations](#paused-animations) instead,
and it looks like my attempt works on Firefox as well. üéâ

## So, which one is better?

I‚Äôve summarized the pros and cons of each method below:

</td>

</table>

The most important consideration is the API we want to expose to component users.
After all, exposing a nicer API is the whole point of this, right?

If your custom property makes sense as a number _without degrading usability_
(e.g. `--size` may make sense as a number, but `small | medium | large` is still better than `0 | 1 | 2`),
then [Binary Linear Interpolation](#binary-linear-interpolation) is probably the most flexible method to start with,
and as we have seen in [Combining approaches](#combining-approaches) section, numbers can be converted to inputs for every other method.

However, in the vast majority of cases I have seen, the [north star API](../../2023/eigensolutions/#nsui) is a set of plain, high-level keywords.
This is only possible via [Type Grinding](#type-grinding) and [Variable animation names](#named-paused-animations).

Between the two, Type Grinding is the one providing the best encapsulation,
since it relies entirely on custom properties and does not hijack any native properties.

Unfortunately, the fact that [`@property` is not yet supported in Shadow DOM](https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/MWdQxyG) throws a spanner in the works,
but since these intermediate properties are only used for internal calculations,
we can just give them obscure names and insert them in the light DOM.

On the other hand, [`@keyframes` are not only allowed, but also properly scoped when used in Shadow DOM](https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/gOJvEMw),
so [Variable animation name](#variable-animation-name) might be a good choice when you don‚Äôt want to use the same keywords for multiple custom properties on the same component
and its downsides are not dealbreakers for your particular use case.

## Conclusion

Phew! That was a long one. If you‚Äôre aware of any other techniques, let me know so I can add them.

And I think after all of this, if you had any doubt that we need `if()` in CSS,
the sheer number and horribleness of these hacks _must_ have dispelled it by now. üòÖ

Yesterday, I had a session at [MediaCampAthens](http://mediacamp.gr) (a BarCamp-style event), regarding CSS3 colors. If you've followed [my earlier posts tagged with "colors"](http://lea.verou.me/tag/colors/), my presentation was mostly a sum-up of these.

It was my first presentation ever, actually, the first time I talked to an audience for more than 1 minute :P . This caused some goofs:

- When introducing myself, I said completely different things than I intended to and ended up sounding like an arrogant moron :P
- I tried not to look at the audience too much, in order to avoid sounding nervous, and this caused me to completely ignore 2 questions (as I found out afterwards)! How embarrasing!
- At a certain point, I said "URL" instead of "domain" :P

Also, I had prepared some screenshots (you'll see them in the ppt) and the projector completely screwed them up, as it showed any dark color as black.

Apart from those, I think it went very well, I received lots of positive feedback about it and the audience was paying attention, so I guess they found it interesting (something that I didn't expect :P ).

Here is the presentation:

Please note that Slideshare messed up slide #8 and the background seems semi-transparent grey instead of semi-transparent white.

By the way, I also thought afterwards that I had made a mistake: -ms-filter is not required if we combine the gradient filter with Data URIs, since IE8 supports Data URIs (for images at least). Oops, I hate making mistakes that I can't correct.

[Here are some photos from my session](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/album.php?aid=66598&id=796271191). If I did it correctly, every facebook user can see them. If I messed things up, tell me :P

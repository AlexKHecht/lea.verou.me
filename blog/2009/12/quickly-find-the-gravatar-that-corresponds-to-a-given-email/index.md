Today I needed to quickly find the Gravatars that corresponded to a bunch of email addresses for some reason (don't ask). After a bit of googling and wandering around in [Gravatar's official site](http://gravatar.com) and others, I firgured out it's probably much quicker to write a short PHP script for that myself, than keep looking.

Here it is, in case someone ever needs to do something similar: (click on the screenshot)

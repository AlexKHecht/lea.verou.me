In case anyone is interested, [this is my take](http://lea.verou.me/scripts/css3learn.html) on the ["challenge" that Brad Neuberg posted today on Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/archives/interactive-css-3-generator). It needs more properties, but it's very easy to extend. I guess I should also add CSS3 values (RGBA/HSL(A) colors, CSS gradients etc) but oh well, I'm currently in a hurry. I will, if anyone actually finds it useful (?).

It didn't prove much of a challenge actually and I honestly doubt it's educational value (actually it's value in general), but it was an interesting thing to do while drinking my first coffee in the morning -- I really enjoyed writing it :)

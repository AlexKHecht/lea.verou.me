If you are a creative professional, or just passionate about colors, please take my survey:

http://bit.ly/colorsurvey

It will greatly help me to make a future project of our company more usable (some of its features at least) and it only takes a few minutes (it contains 10-19 questions, depending on your responses).

Any suggestions, corrections, questions etc are of course welcome.

Thanks a lot in advance to everyone that takes the survey! :D

Of course, when it ends and I find the time to analyze the results, I'll post them here for anyone interested. (Hint: That means that if you are interested in the results, you can promote the survey yourself as well, since more responses = more accurate results)

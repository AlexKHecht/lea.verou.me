[![](images/csspatterns-300x177.png "Screenshot from the gallery")](images/csspatterns.png)I finally got around to doing what I wanted to do for quite a few months: Create a gallery with all the basic patterns I was able to create with CSS3 gradients. Here it is:Â  [CSS3 Pattern Gallery](http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/)

Also, it includes a brand new pattern, which is the hardest one I have ever made so far: Japanese cubes. Thanks to [David Storey](http://twitter.com/dstorey) for challenging me about it.

Supported browsers:

- Firefox 4 (the patterns themselves work on 3.6 too but the gallery doesn't due to a JS limitation)
- Opera 11.10
- IE10
- Google Chrome
- Webkit nightlies

However bear in mind that every implementation has its limitations so a few of them won't work in all the aforementioned browsers (for example Opera doesn't support radial gradients and Firefox doesn't support explicitly sized ones).

I don't usually post shameless plugs like that, but I'm so excited about this I decided to make an exception. A few minutes ago I found out that I'm shortlisted in the ["Brilliant newcomer" category](http://www.thenetawards.com/#num12) of [The .net awards](http://www.thenetawards.com/)!!!

Thank you so much @ everyone that nominated me and/or plans to vote for me. I really appreciate it guys\*! :)

\* "guys" in that context is used in a gender neutral fashion, I'm not only thanking the men :P

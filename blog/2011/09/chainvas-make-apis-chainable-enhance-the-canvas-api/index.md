[![](images/chainvas-300x228.png "chainvas page screenshot")](images/chainvas.png)It's definitely not the first time someone writes a script to make the canvas API chainable, as [a quick Google search](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=chainable+canvas) will confirm.

However, I think my attempt has merit, because it's not really focused in chaining canvas methods, but just about every API you use it on and because it's super small, only 1KB!

You can find it here: [chainvas](http://lea.verou.me/chainvas/)

Enjoy!

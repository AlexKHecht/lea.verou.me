Thought I'd let you know that [my Smashing Magazine article with that title](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/help-the-community-report-browser-bugs/)Â was published today. It discusses why, how, when and where to report browser bugs, as well as how to make a good bug report.

Get comfortable and make a big cup of coffee before you dive in, as it's quite long (4000 words).

I had grown sick of my previous blog style and its various bugs (since it was put together in just a few hours), so I decided to make a new, more minimalistic one. Best viewed in browsers that support CSS gradients, like Firefox, Safari and Chrome. I also finally got around to making a logo for myself, although I'm not sure I'll keep it. I also switched to HTML5, using [Toolbox](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/toolbox) as a base.

I want to make a few more changes, but I have to go to sleep sometime :p

I also started using [DISQUS](http://disqus.com/) for the blog comments. I like it when a blog I read has it (since it offers a few features I find convenient, like comment editing for instance), so I wanted to offer it to my readers too.Â It's a shame that in some of their buttons they haven't added the standard CSS3 border-radius declarations, but only the prefixed proprietary ones, so they're square in Opera (and probably IE9). I'm fed up with seeing this in websites, [TOPSY](http://topsy.com/)'s widget also does it. However, their carelessness will backfire soon, when browsers stop supporting the prefixed versions \*evil grin\*

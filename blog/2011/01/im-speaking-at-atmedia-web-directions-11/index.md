Just a quick note to let you know I'm speaking at [this year's @media Web Directions](http://atmedia11.webdirections.org/) conference, which will take place during May 26–27 in London, UK. I'm very excited about this, since I always considered @media one of the top front-end conferences in the industry :)

The title and abstract of [my talk](http://atmedia11.webdirections.org/program/design/#css3-at-the-outer-rim) is as follows:

> ### CSS3 at the Outer Rim
>
> By now most of you know how to use the core CSS3 features in your designs to embed custom fonts and easily create rounded corners, drop shadows, and scalable designs with media queries. But there is still a large area of CSS3 that remains unexplored by most web designers and developers. In this talk Lea will present many CSS3 features that are useful but underrated, as well as uncommon ways of utilising the CSS3 features you already know about, in order to do much more with even fewer images and less code.

Although it’s on the design track, I expect it to appeal to both developers and designers.

Hope to see you there! :D

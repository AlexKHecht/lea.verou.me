I decided to start writing a blog post after every talk I give, to be able to go back and remember what I thought about each event, what feedback my talk got etc. And I'm starting with [Geek Meet May 2011](http://robertnyman.com/2011/04/06/geek-meet-may-2011-with-lea-verou/).

## The event

Geek Meet is a meetup organized in Stockholm by [Robert Nyman](http://robertnyman.com/). It has hosted talks by many industry leaders like [Jake Archibald](http://robertnyman.com/2011/01/12/geek-meet-february-2011-with-jake-archibald/), [Bruce Lawson](http://robertnyman.com/2010/09/06/geek-meet-september-2010-with-bruce-lawson/), [Molly Holzschlag](http://robertnyman.com/2009/09/21/geek-meet-october-2009-molly-holzschlag-will-present-about-html-5-and-other-goodies/), [Chris Mills, Remy Sharp](http://robertnyman.com/2009/05/04/geek-meet-charity-june-4th-2009-chris-mills-and-remy-sharp-speaking/), [Christian Heilmann](http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/16/geek-meet-december-2008-chris-heilmann-presentations/) and more. It's free to attend and has sponsors so it can afford to offer free food, drinks and speaker accommodation.

## My experience

I was very surprised to hear that the event was sold out just 18 minutes after Robert's announcement! According to him, that set a new record for it!

This event was kinda challenging in many ways. I was the only speaker, so if I failed, everyone would notice. Also, I had to give 2 talks and one of them was brand new, which is always stressful.

However, the crowd there was awesome! Not only they were very relaxed, but they had a great sense of humor too. I don't think I had ever been in an event that was so relaxed. And their reaction to my talks was so encouraging, I don't think I have ever heard such loud clapping in my life!

I'm saving the feedback I got here, to bottle the feeling:

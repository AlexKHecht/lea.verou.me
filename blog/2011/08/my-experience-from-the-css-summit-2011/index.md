It's been a few days since [this year's CSS Summit](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2011/css-summit/) and my talk there. Where most people would assume that public speaking in a "real" conference is more daunting, I was much more nervous about this one, since it was my first talk at an online conference. I wouldn't be able to see the faces of the audience, so how would I be able to tell if they like it or are bored shitless? Also, the whole idea of me, alone in a room, giving a talk to my laptop sounded kind of awkward, to say the very least.

Contrary to my fears, it was a **very** pleasant experience. In some ways, it's much better than real-life conferences, the main one being the number of questions you get. In most real-life conferences you should be lucky to get more than 3 or 4 questions. Also, they're usually at the end, so most attendees forget the questions they had at the beginning and middle of the talk (it happens to me a lot too, when I attend others' talks). In the CSS Summit, I answered questions after every section of my talk, and there were quite a lot of them.

The attendees had a group chat in which they talked about the presentation, posted questions and discussed many other stuff. That group chat was the other thing I really liked. It might surprise some people, but even though I'm not afraid of public speaking, I'm quite shy in some ways and I almost never talk to someone first. So, if I didn't know anyone at a conference and vice versa, I'd probably sit in a corner alone with nobody to talk to during the breaks. The chat makes it much easier for attendees to get to know each other. On the minus side however, "meeting" somebody in a chat is not by any means the same as really meeting someone f2f in a real-life conference.

Regarding my talk, it went surprisingly well. No technical hiccups like some of the other talks, no me going overtime as I was afraid I would (since I had to be slower), no internet connection failing on my part (like it sometimes does lately). I received lots of enthusiastic feedback on both the chat and twitter. I couldn't even favorite them all, as the tweets were so many! That's the 3rd good thing about online conferences: People tweet more, since they're at home with their regular connection and not with a crappy conference wifi or a smartphone on expensive roaming.

Here's a small sample of the feedback I got:

Deborah Edwards-Onoro also put together a [write-up](http://deboraheo.posterous.com/css-summit-2011-css3-and-gradients-by-lea-ver) for some parts of my presentation.

Thank you all!!

[My newest article on Smashing Magazine's coding section](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/19/optimizing-long-lists-of-yesno-values-with-javascript/) is for the geekiest among you. It's about how you can pack long lists of boolean values into a string in the most space-efficient way. Hope you enjoy it :)

[![](images/Screen-shot-2011-11-15-at-14.33.38--300x187.png "-prefix-free project page screenshot")](images/Screen-shot-2011-11-15-at-14.33.38-.png)I wrote this script while at the airport travelling to Oslo and during the [Frontend 2011 conference](http://www.frontend2011.com/). I think it's amazing, and it makes authoring CSS3 a pleasure.

Recently, Jake Archibald wrote a [post](https://jakearchibald.com/2023/against-self-closing-tags-in-html/) arguing against self-closing tags in HTML.
He is of course not arguing against the pressence of self-closing tags in HTML, as that ship has sailed long ago,
but against the practice of signifying that an element is self closing via the `/` character at the end of the opening tag,
a remnant of XHTML that is still valid in HTML5.

Surprisingly, I disagree with him (this may be a first!). ðŸ˜€
Code conventions exist to minimize cognitive overhead and minimize the need for memorization.

We donâ€™t use semicolons in JS or quotes around HTML attributes because they are necessary, but to avoid having to internalize the rules around omitting them.

When one sees `<input>` or `<img>`, they must remember that these are self-closing tags to be able to tell that this is not an authoring mistake,
while `/>` clearly communicates the author intent.
Sure, to anyone that has been writing HTML for a while the (relatively short) [list of self-closing elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element) is practically in their BIOS.
However, it still requires actually *reading* the element name to know that itâ€™s self-closing, while `/>` can be recognized pictorially, as an icon,
which is a much faster neural path.
Reading a word takes ~250ms with an average reading speed of 240 wpm [^1], while recognizing a symbol or icon takes less than 100ms. [^2].
Furthermore, this convention makes HTML markup easier to understand by those without the experience to know the list of self-closing elements by heart.
